## Release

Release is done for `bash` and `brew` installations. We support only darwin-arm64 ( macos m1 ) for now.
To cut a new release, [publish a new tag](https://github.com/reverbdotcom/sbx/releases) following semver.

## Development

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is public repo. Do not commit any secrets or sensitive information.
> Simpler for brew install. Though we can work with an internal repo with `HOMEBREW_GITHUB_API_TOKEN` set.

`sbx.go` is the main entry point for the CLI tool.
Every command should be a go package. Commands are
configured in `commands/commands.go`.


`make <command>.run` will build and run the command.
This runs live.

#### Test
`make test`
`make <package>.test`
`make <test file>`

#### Test with another repo

Run, in any orchestra enabled repo.

```bash
export GOPRIVATE=github.com/reverbdotcom && go install github.com/reverbdotcom/sbx@your-test-branch
```

`sbx` now points to your branch version.
